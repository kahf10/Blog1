# README

This is my first project in Ruby on Rails. I was following different guides to build a Blog that allowed me to post articles and comments on them. 

* Ruby version - 3.0.0

The Steps: 
1. Created a new Ruby on Rails project that I could locally host on my machine. 
2. Learned about CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). CRUD are the key features I wanted to test and add to this project. 
3. First created a single article and checked how the controller handled the request and the data is displayed. 
4. Then I modified the controller such that I could create multiple controllers. 
5. I then added deletion and updating abilities to articles. 
6. In order to make the blog more realistic, I added comments to eat with similar features. 
7. I then added concerns to make the controllers for both the articles and comments easy to manage. 
8. I also added the ability to delete comments. 
9. While doing this, I added access specifiers to articles so that each article could be classified as either 'public', 'private' or 'archived'. 
10. I finally added a http authentication whenever a user tries to add an article.
